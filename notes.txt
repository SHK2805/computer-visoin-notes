### Image Variations
Computer vision models use various image variations to improve their accuracy and robustness. 
These variations help the model generalize better and handle different conditions. 
Here are some common image variations used:

1. **Rotation**: Images are rotated to different angles to help the model recognize objects from various orientations.
2. **Scaling**: Images are resized to different scales, which aids the model in understanding objects of different sizes.
3. **Cropping**: Parts of the image are randomly cropped to help the model focus on different portions and maintain its effectiveness even when only parts of the object are visible.
4. **Flipping**: Images are flipped horizontally or vertically to provide mirrored versions, which can help the model recognize objects from different perspectives.
5. **Brightness Adjustment**: The brightness of images is altered to make the model robust to different lighting conditions.
6. **Contrast Adjustment**: Adjusting the contrast of images helps the model handle varying contrasts in real-world scenarios.
7. **Color Jittering**: Randomly changing the hue, saturation, and brightness of images to make the model more adaptable to different color variations.
8. **Noise Addition**: Adding random noise to images to make the model more resilient to noisy or low-quality inputs.
9. **Occlusion**: Partially covering objects in images to train the model to recognize objects even when they are partially hidden.
10. **Affine Transformations**: Applying transformations like shearing, scaling, and rotating to simulate different viewpoints and perspectives.

These variations, among others, are used during the training process to augment the dataset and improve the model's performance in real-world applications. 
By exposing the model to a wide range of variations, it becomes better at generalizing and recognizing objects under different conditions.
